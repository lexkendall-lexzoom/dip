  review: "This is the one you bring someone you want to impress — or someone you already have. Eight thermal pools, a rooftop plunge open to the sky, and Aufguss ceremonies that feel closer to performance art than spa therapy. The banya hits 195°F and the cold plunge hits 45°F. That gap is the entire point."
