  review: "The hardest wellness membership to get in New York right now, and it is not close. Rooted in Japanese sentō tradition by a founder who grew up going to public baths in Tokyo, Akari is what that looks like when you bring it to Brooklyn and do it right. Small, quiet, currently sold out at both locations."
