  subtitle: Editorial review, practical details, and booking context from Dip.
  review: Designed for frequency, not occasion. Dry sauna, infrared sauna, and a
    serious cold plunge pool — built by alumni of Lifetime Fitness and NeueHouse
    who understand daily-use design. At $225/month for unlimited weekday access,
    it reframes bathing as routine rather than indulgence.
