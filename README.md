# DIP

DIP is a directory for bathhouses, contrast bathing, and other wellness facilities.

## Current state

- Static single-page prototype in `index.html`
- Includes city tabs, map integration (Leaflet), filters, and venue cards
- Venue data is embedded in the page script

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser. The map uses external Leaflet assets and needs internet access to render.

## Next build steps

1. Split data into JSON files (per city)
2. Move styles and scripts into separate files
3. Add real email capture backend (currently demo-only)
4. Add CMS/admin workflow for venue updates
